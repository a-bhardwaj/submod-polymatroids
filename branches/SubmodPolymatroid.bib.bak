  abstract = {We describe a new solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programs
	(MINLPs) that implements a linearization-based algorithm. The solver
	is based on an algorithm of Quesada and Grossmann [Quesada, I., I.
	E. Grossmann. 1992. An LP/NLP based branch-and-bound algorithm for
	convex MINLP optimization problems. Comput. Chemical Engrg. 16(10–11)
	937–947] that avoids the complete re-solution of a master mixed-integer
	linear program (MILP) by adding new linearizations at open nodes
	of the branch-and-bound tree whenever an integer solution is found.
	The new solver, FilMINT, combines the MINTO branch-and-cut framework
	for MILP with filterSQP to solve the nonlinear programs that arise
	as subproblems in the algorithm. The MINTO framework allows us to
	easily employ cutting planes, primal heuristics, and other well-known
	MILP enhancements for MINLPs. We present detailed computational experiments
	that show the benefit of such advanced MILP techniques. We offer
	new suggestions for generating and managing linearizations that are
	shown to be efficient on a wide range of MINLPs. By carefully incorporating
	and tuning all these enhancements, an effective solver for convex
	MINLPs is constructed.},

  journal = {Operations Research},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {55},
  pages = {662-673},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {We describe a two-stage robust optimization approach for solving network
	flow and design problems with uncertain demand. In two-stage network
	optimization, one defers a subset of the flow decisions until after
	the realization of the uncertain demand. Availability of such a recourse
	action allows one to come up with less conservative solutions compared
	to single-stage optimization. However, this advantage often comes
	at a price: two-stage optimization is, in general, significantly
	harder than single-stage optimization.For network flow and design
	under demand uncertainty, we give a characterization of the first-stage
	robust decisions with an exponential number of constraints and prove
	that the corresponding separation problem is -hard even for a network
	flow problem on a bipartite graph. We show, however, that if the
	second-stage network topology is totally ordered or an arborescence,
	then the separation problem is tractable.Unlike single-stage robust
	optimization under demand uncertainty, two-stage robust optimization
	allows one to control conservatism of the solutions by means of an
	allowed “budget for demand uncertainty.” Using a budget of uncertainty,
	we provide an upper bound on the probability of infeasibility of
	a robust solution for a random demand vector.We generalize the approach
	to multicommodity network flow and design, and give applications
	to lot-sizing and location-transportation problems. By projecting
	out second-stage flow variables, we define an upper bounding problem
	for the two-stage min-max-min optimization problem. Finally, we present
	computational results comparing the proposed two-stage robust optimization
	approach with single-stage robust optimization as well as scenario-based
	two-stage stochastic optimization.},

	give a necessary and sufficient condition for all lower bounds to
	be equal to the corresponding upper bounds, i.e. for the facet associated

	order on the set of minimal covers and show that all facets associated
	with minimal covers can be obtained from weak covers; but that each
	facet obtainable from several ordered minimal covers is easiest to
	compute from the strongest one. Further, we characterize the class
	of all facets associated with minimal covers, and show that the facets
	obtainable by Padberg's sequential lifting procedure are precisely
	those members of the class which have integer coefficients for a
	certain right-hand side. We then give a procedure for generating
	the other (simultaneously) lifted facets, which have fractional coefficients
	for the same right-hand side.},

	the problem of finding a minimum cost network design, satisfying

	design problem. For its solution, two heuristics approaches are devised
	and implemented. Their performance is evaluated on a set of well-known
	test problems. The computational results collected are very encouraging,

  abstract = {Chance constrained programming admits random data variations and permits
	constraint violations up to specified probability limits. Different
	kinds of decision rules and optimizing objectives may be used so
	that, under certain conditions, a programming problem (not necessarily
	linear) can be achieved that is deterministic-in that all random
	elements have been eliminated. Existence of such 'deterministic equivalents'
	in the form of specified convex programming problems is here established
	for a general class of linear decision rules under the following
	3 classes of objectives: (1) maximum expected value ('E model');
	(2) minimum variance ('V model'); and (3) maximum probability ('P
	model'). Various explanations and interpretations of these results
	are supplied along with other aspects of chance constrained programming.
	For example, the 'P model' is interpreted so that H. A. Simon's suggestions
	for 'satisficing' can be studied relative to more traditional optimizing
	objectives associated with 'E' and 'V model' variants.},

	as mean-variance or Value-at-Risk (VaR) approaches, can result in
	a portfolio extremely sensitive to errors in the data, such as mean
	and covariance matrix of the returns. In this paper we propose a
	way to alleviate this problem in a tractable manner. We assume that
	the distribution of returns is partially known, in the sense that
	only bounds on the mean and covariance matrix are available. We define
	the worst-case Value-at-Risk as the largest VaR attainable, given
	the partial information on the returns' distribution. We consider
	the problem of computing and optimizing the worst-case VaR, and we
	show that these problems can be cast as semidefinite programs. We
	extend our approach to various other partial information on the distribution,
	including uncertainty in factor models, support constraints, and
	relative entropy information.},

	are random variables. This gives a multistage stochastic linear program.
	We describe the randomness using a multi-scenario approach. Because
	of the multilayered structure, there are several ways to decompose
	the linear program. We classify different decomposition schemes,
	and we develop a scheme called compath decomposition, which is derived
	from path decomposition for network flows. We give a polynomial-time
	algorithm to find a cheapest compath that can solve the subproblems
	resulting from compath decomposition. Finally, compath decomposition
	is extended to multicommodity flow problems.},

	feasible solutions to separable nonlinear multidimensional knapsack
	problems is developed by exploiting discontinuity preserving properties
	of the maximal convolution. The "curse of dimensionality", which
	is usually associated with dynamic programming algorithms, is successfully
	mitigated by reducing an M-dimensional dynamic program to a 1-dimensional
	dynamic program through the use of the imbedded state space approach.
	Computational experience with the algorithm on problems with as many
	as 10 state variables is also reported and several interesting extensions
	are discussed.},

	The algorithm is tested on a series of portfolio optimization problems.

	solvers based on both linear and nonlinear relaxations.},
